                                <p>Samyama tries to obtain visas on clients’ behalf based on the validity, length and
                                    speed of process requested by them. However, if the visa is delayed, refused or
                                    the validity or length of visa is different than expected, the company does not
                                    accept any responsibility as issuance of the visa is entirely embassy’s decision. It
                                    is clients’ responsibility to check validity of the passport, visa or other document
                                    issued to make sure it covers requested period of the trip, is valid to travel and
                                    purpose of the trip is stated correctly. If the documents issued do not meet
                                    these criteria, client should notify us as soon as possible so the mistake can be
                                    rectified if possible. We also do not take any responsibility for incorrectly or
                                    falsely filled in application forms or information provided by clients as Samyama
                                    is submitting applications based on information provided by clients. Samyama
                                    cannot be held responsible for any loss or damage of the documents by the
