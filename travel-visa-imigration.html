                                    wonder about the difference between tourist, business, and Schengen visas. In fact, there is little
                                    difference. The term &#39;Schengen visa&#39; is a general term used for a visa issued for travel to certain
                                    European countries for tourist and business purposes. The key distinction is that it is specifically
                                    issued to travelers intending to visit countries within the Schengen Area. In most cases, a single
                                    Schengen visa is valid for travel to all Schengen Area countries, which include Austria, Belgium, the
                                    Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia,

                                    However, there is no one-size-fits-all set of required documents for all countries. Each government
                                    has its own rules and regulations, which can sometimes be confusing or time-consuming to
