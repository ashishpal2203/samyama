                            European countries and often
                            wonder about the difference between tourist, business, and Schengen visas. In fact, there is
                            little
                            difference. The term &#39;Schengen visa&#39; is a general term used for a visa issued for
                            travel to certain
                            European countries for tourist and business purposes. The key distinction is that it is
                            specifically
                            issued to travelers intending to visit countries within the Schengen Area. In most cases, a
                            single
                            Schengen visa is valid for travel to all Schengen Area countries, which include Austria,
                            Belgium, the

                            However, there is no one-size-fits-all set of required documents for all countries. Each
                            government
                            has its own rules and regulations, which can sometimes be confusing or time-consuming to
